/* Tests buffer cache. */
/*
Test your buffer cacheâ€™s effectiveness by measuring its cache hit rate. 
First, reset the buffer cache. Next, open a file and read it sequentially, 
to determine the cache hit rate for a cold cache. 
Then, close it, re-open it, and read it sequentially again, to make sure that the cache hit rate improves.
